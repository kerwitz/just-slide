## [0.9.0](https://github.com/kerwitz/just-slide/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

This is the first public release of just-slide.
It contains a rather stable [public API](https://github.com/kerwitz/just-slide#public-api) but it is
yet to be tested across different browsers and use-cases. This release *should* be mostly stable but
may have unknown bugs or incompatibilities.

When using this version you need to check cross browser support for your desired audience by yourself
(but please report back on #1).

Please help by reporting any anomalies as [issues](https://github.com/kerwitz/just-slide/issues) and [contributing](https://github.com/kerwitz/just-slide#contributing) to the project.
